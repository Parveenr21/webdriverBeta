WEBDRIVER 3

##########################################################################################
Firstly to use GECKO driver by Marionette needs us to use webdriver 3.3 or more.

GECKO driver needs selenium 47 and above.

GECKO driver is firefox driver which now supports much rich apis to operate on firefox as compare to native firefox driver.

Please download latest GECKO driver ..unlike firefox driver.. GECKO driver does not come bundled in seleniumStandalone.jar

so dowload it from external site.


With Selenium 3.0 and later, you shouldn't need to do anything to use Marionette, as it's enabled by default.
but If we want to use FIRFOX driver we can turn off MARIONETTE capability

cap = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
cap.setCapability("marionette", false);	// but here we also need old firefox version as new one does not support firefox driver.



in case we are using old firefox but latest webdriver which uses geckodriver.. then it will give
org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException

##########################################################################################

//GENERAL question.. driver= new firefoxdriver(cap); // This opens the plain browser with nothing in address bar

//close vs quit..  closes close current browser pane and does not nullify the driver instance.. while quit closes all instances and nullify driver.
//quit calls dispose.. driver.dispose was there earlieer now ..no more..

org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchSessionException: Session ID is null. Using WebDriver after calling quit()?
