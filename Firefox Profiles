Firefox Profiles

There are 2 ways of handling profiles in firefox

1. GET and READ already created and set profile .. we can also customize settings by code.

2. We can create object of default RUNNING profile when webdriver runs test in one TEST default profile and customize this
profile settings..



so both ways.. we are not creating profile but one is customizing an already  created profile if needed and another is
customizing TEST execution default profile.



1. If we have created a profile already

 	ProfilesIni profile = new ProfilesIni(); 		//Profile initilizer
	FirefoxProfile myprofile =profile.getProfile("webdriverProfile"); //Getting profile by profile name using profile initilizer
	myprofile.setAcceptUntrustedCertificates(true); //Setting a preference
	driver=new FirefoxDriver(myprofile);
	
	
	
	2. Using TEST default profile.. creating object of that
	
	
		FirefoxProfile myprofile = new FirefoxProfile();	//not reading any profile..
		 myprofile.setAcceptUntrustedCertificates(true);//Setting a preference
		 driver=new FirefoxDriver(myprofile);
